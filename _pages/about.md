I am M.A. in Education and Society at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) (Thesis Option), supervised by Professor [Annie Savard](https://www.mcgill.ca/dise/annie-savard). Recently, I received B.A. in Communication and Journalism from [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Yimin Hao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%83%9D%E4%B8%80%E6%B0%91/3922983). My research interests include Computational Thinking, Digital Learning and Cognitive Development.



My interest in Digital Learning and Computational Thinking developed when I did a project regarding Users' information sharing behaviors, advised by Prof.[Yimin Hao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%83%9D%E4%B8%80%E6%B0%91/3922983/). Afterwards, I followed my interest to intern at [Science and Technology Daily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Technology_Daily), under the supervision of Ms. Chun Wang, focusing on educational technologies, technology industries. Recently, I work on a project related to Computational Thinking and Cognitive Development, advised by Prof. [Annie Savard](https://www.mcgill.ca/dise/annie-savard) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).



I am also an enthusiast in Front-End, Human-Computer Interaction, who want to help women in Tech.
